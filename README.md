# UK Government Petitions - React

Project that uses React to search the comprehensive data available on the UK Government's petition site. The site provides a JSON feed for each petition that contains data such as when a petition was opened/closed/debated/rejected and breaks down how many signatures were submitted per country and per constituency.

Make sure you have `webpack-dev-server` installed and run it through that. It will run on port 9000.
